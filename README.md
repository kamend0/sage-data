# Purpose

This repo contains code used to clean and load recipes data to MongoDB Atlas and AWS S3.

## Data Used

Data for all recipes was pulled from a dataset I found on Kaggle put together by Sakshi Goel, Amogh Desai, and Tanvi, originally scraped from Epicurious. Source link:

Huge thanks to them for putting this together; this project would not have been possible without them. All rights to the recipes in this project ultimately go to each of those platforms.
