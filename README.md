# Purpose

This repo contains code used to clean and load recipes data to MongoDB Atlas for use in mint-green-recipes. See corresponding repo for server code.

## Data Used

Data for all recipes was pulled from a dataset I found on eightportions.com, called Recipebox. The website and its creator's GitHub repo for it can be found at the following links, respectively:

https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/

https://github.com/rtlee9/recipe-box

Huge thanks to them for putting that together, this would not have been possible without them. The recipes are originally from Food Network, Epicurious, and Allrecipes.com; their program scraped that data. All rights to the recipes in this project ultimately go to each of those providers.
